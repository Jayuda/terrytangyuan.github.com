    <p>
        I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in Mathematics with honors. 
        I am currently working as a data scientist at <a href="http://uptake.com" style="color:green;">Uptake</a> in Chicago, IL. 
        I focus on building predictive models and streamlined modeling engine used across multiple verticals. 
        I also work in conjunction with software engineering team to make sure the application scales and the communications between teams are effective. </p>

<p>Before joining Uptake, I was a full-time data scientist at <a href="http://gastrograph.com" style="color:green;">Analytical Flavor Systems</a> and my focus was on predictive condition monitoring and flaw detection on artisan beverages such as coffee and beer using sensory science and machine learning. </p>

<p>Since my senior year at Penn State, I've been a founding member of <a href="http://datanovo.com" style="color:green;">DataNovo</a>, a legal analytics company that provides predictive insights, keywordless prior art search, and product assessment on infringement for law firms, patent attorneys, etc.
